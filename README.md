# Encrypt-Lua-GG-V6
<h4>I really like encode using bytecode or byte sequence, it makes the encoding look nicer, more preferred (konzlet or bydnz or from Chinese encrypt they use bytecode), this version still has lasm obfuscate, i don't add antiblocker other than log/hook/load, this is open source (free to edit), you can upgrade your own protection.</h4>
